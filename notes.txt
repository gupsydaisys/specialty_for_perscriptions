######VALIDATE
TODO Validate that each of your randomly chosen data sets has the correct distributions of these
######
- 2/3 beneficiaries in stand-alone Prescription Drug Plans (PDP) 
- 1/3 beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug (MAPD) plans.


######CLEAN

######
If you do apply to Medicare with your Type II NPI, you can file Medicare claims with that information once you’re approved and contracted. Continue to file claims with private payers using your Type I NPI.

nppes_provider_first_name – When the provider is registered in NPPES as an individual
(nppes_entity_code = “I”), this is the provider’s first name. When the provider is registered as an
organization (nppes_entity_code = “O”), this will be blank

The dataset contains information predominantly from individual providers, but also includes a small proportion of
organizational providers, such as nursing homes, group practices, non-physician practitioners,
residential treatment facilities, ambulatory surgery centers, and other providers.



####VALIDATE
Could there be a bias in being able to predict some types of specialties since they don't have enough claims data?
####
To protect the privacy of Medicare beneficiaries, any aggregated records which are derived from 10 or fewer claims are excluded from the Part D Prescriber PUF




####VALIDATE
Will certain specialties just show up less then?
####
Specialty = code associated with the largest number of services is reported
If taximony code, try to map it
